|                         NOTES ABOUT THIS FORK
| This fork was created to fix some bugs that were affecting me (Aziraphale)
|  and a few friends, and implement some features that the same people would
|  find useful. Anyone else is, of course, welcome to download and use one of
|  our builds, but if it's useful for anyone else then that is merely a happy
|  coincidence - we don't have the time nor inclination to make this any kind
|  of "official" project, or to offer any kind of real support if our builds
|  crash or prompt your Android device to create Skynet.
| 
| That said, we'll be making a few pull requests, so hopefully some of our
|  efforts will benefit a slightly wider audience. Feel free to report bugs
|  or make feature requests in our issue tracker, but understand that we're
|  not likely to want to put much effort into things that won't directly
|  benefit us.

| ADDITIONAL AUTHORS:
|  * Andrew Gillard (Aziraphale)
|  * Ben Roberts (optiz0r)
| 
| Here is what we've added/changed so far:
|  * Action (/me) messages will now be considered "normal messages" (blue) in
|    the list of buffers, rather than them being treated like mode changes.
|  * Support for multiple URLs per message via an alert dialog.
|  * Improved URL-matching.
|  * Swipe left/right on a chat view to switch chats.
|  * Fixed colors/formatting.
|  * Added the ability to share text and images into QuasselDroid from other
|    applications. Images are first uploaded to Imgur, then the Imgur URL
|    shared with IRC.
|  * Stopped the soft keyboard being shown automatically when switching to a
|    chat view.
|  * Added an option to keep the screen turned on (and bright) when the
|    device is connected to an external power source (e.g. when the phone is
|    in a desk dock).
|  * Remembers the messages you've sent on a per-buffer basis, allowing
|    access to them via the up/down arrow keys. Will also remember these
|    messages across disconnections (no more losing messages you've typed
|    when your phone loses signal!)
|  * Also keeps typed-but-not-sent messages when you switch between chats.

No requirements apart from a recently modern Android SDK (2.1 should be
sufficient, no guarantees in either directions, though).

It uses the following extra projects (though all support libraries are included
for your convenience):
    - Otto: http://square.github.com/otto/
    - Android Support Library: http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html
    - Crittercism: https://www.crittercism.com/developers/docs-android


We do support encryption, but no compression support for now (qCompress should,
in theory, be compatible with Deflater if you do some pre-parsing massaging on
it, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet).
