|                         NOTES ABOUT THIS FORK
| This fork was created to fix some bugs that were affecting me (Aziraphale)
|  and a few friends, and implement some features that the same people would
|  find useful. Anyone else is, of course, welcome to download and use one of
|  our builds, but if it's useful for anyone else then that is merely a happy
|  coincidence - we don't have the time nor inclination to make this any kind
|  of "official" project, or to offer any kind of real support if our builds
|  crash or prompt your Android device to create Skynet.
| 
| That said, we'll be making a few pull requests, so hopefully some of our
|  efforts will benefit a slightly wider audience. Feel free to report bugs
|  or make feature requests in our issue tracker, but understand that we're
|  not likely to want to put much effort into things that won't directly
|  benefit us.
| 
| ADDITIONAL AUTHORS:
|  * Andrew Gillard (Aziraphale)
|  * Ben Roberts (optiz0r)
| 
| Here is what we've added/changed so far:
|  * Action (/me) messages will now be considered "normal messages" (blue) in
|    the list of buffers, rather than them being treated like mode changes.
|  * Support for multiple URLs per message via an alert dialog.
|  * Improved URL-matching.
|  * Swipe left/right on a chat view to switch chats.
|  * Fixed colors/formatting.
|  * Added the ability to share text and images into QuasselDroid from other
|    applications. Images are first uploaded to Imgur, then the Imgur URL
|    shared with IRC.
|  * Stopped the soft keyboard being shown automatically when switching to a
|    chat view.
|  * Added an option to keep the screen turned on (and bright) when the
|    device is connected to an external power source (e.g. when the phone is
|    in a desk dock).
|  * Remembers the messages you've sent on a per-buffer basis, allowing
|    access to them via the up/down arrow keys. Will also remember these
|    messages across disconnections (no more losing messages you've typed
|    when your phone loses signal!)
|  * Also keeps typed-but-not-sent messages when you switch between chats.

It requires a recent Android SDK , and the new build system.
- http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and
- http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system#TOC-Contributing

It uses the following extra projects (though all support libraries are included
for your convenience):
    - Otto: http://square.github.com/otto/
    - Android Support Library: http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html
    - Crittercism: https://www.crittercism.com/developers/docs-android
    - ActionBarSherlock: http://actionbarsherlock.com/
NB! Android Support Library requires the corresponding package to be installed in the SDK manager 

Building:
Building is done using gradle. Run "gradlew tasks" to see possible build tasks. Some useful tasks are
assemble and installDebug
NB! I have found some bugs with the build system where i have to run --info and or --stacktrace to not get errors
during build process.


We do support encryption, but no compression support for now (qCompress should,
in theory, be compatible with Deflater if you do some pre-parsing massaging on
it, but I haven't gotten it to work just yet).
